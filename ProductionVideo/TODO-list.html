fix the manifest from the given example: <br />
find out if current extension is correct<br /><br />

make an app.js<br />

<h2>Things to remember</h2><br />

<p>
Document every move<br />
Use code wherever possible<br /><br />
Examples:

<p>Make a counter or better put a tracker to show the fish co-ordinates. When the two ar equal ( with an offset )
and mouth to mouth make add a number to the height and width of a heart bubble. When it reaches a preset size
it will float to the top and add opacity to a large translucent heart. I need to know exactly where the fish are while developing
so I can make an algorithm to do this. kisses weaken after just a few and the fish has to eat or visit othe fish to get strenghth back 
to kiss again. </p>
